abstract: "This project served as a light-hearted way to create a website that featured a little custom JavaScript. The goals of the project were as following:
	<ul>
	<li>Feature a random joke on refresh
	<li>Two joke categories: One-liners and Traditional
	<li>Feature a decent and simple web design
	<li>Have an excuse to store my favorite corny jokes forever
	</ul>
	While this webpage is mainly just a portfolio item, it was a fun small project that acts as a reference for future creations."
end: A Jokeful Day is a simple corny joke generator that utilizes a little custom JavaScript to generate the joke on refresh. While the project itself is simple and small, it provides a good example of my ability to use JavaScript to manipulate websites.<br><br><a href="http://ajokefulday.ml" target="_blank" rel="noopener" alt="{{ link.icon }}"><b class="icon-link"></b> Visit AJokefulDay.ml.</a><br>

<p>Like my previous projects, this portfolio website and WhatAKerfuffle, AJokefulDay webpage is hosted entirely for free. For further details on free web hosting, <a href="/portfolio/what-a-kerfuffle">WhatAKerfuffle's project write-up</a> explains hows to have an entirely free webpage. In summary, hosting for free comes with two limitations: no https and a .ml protocol identifier. Since this webpage is mainly for show and it collects no sensitive information, these were acceptable costs for having an entirely free webpage.<br><br>

When creating the webpage's name and logo I only had one idea: the word 'joke' with a sun as the 'o'. Below are the four different styles I was initially considering.</p>

<div class="img-wrap full">
	<div class="img-center">
		<img width="100%" style="max-width:500px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/project/{{ page.projectFolder }}/logo-design.png" alt="Logo Design for A Jokeful Day">
	</div>
</div>

<p>Building off this, I sought for anything related to the sun or light. It took a few days, but at last the phrase "A Jokeful Day" dawned on me. It's intended to sound like "A Joyful Day" and plays on how jokes can "brighten up your day." These tie in with the sun in the logo. I selected my favorite version of 'joke' from above and finished the logo.</p>

<div class="img-wrap full">
	<div class="img-center">
		<img width="100%" style="max-width:500px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/project/{{ page.projectFolder }}/final-logo.png" alt="Final Logo for A Jokeful Day">
	</div>
</div>

<p>With the logo in place, it was time to create the webpage to match. Based on the requirements above, the only content the webpage features is a random joke, categories, and general footer content.</p>

<div class="img-wrap full">
	<div class="img-center">
		<img width="100%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/project/{{ page.projectFolder }}/web-design.png" alt="Web Design for A Jokeful Day">
	</div>
</div>

<p>Naturally, the critical feature of the webpage is the random joke generator. Since Jekyll is only a static webpage generator, it required JavaScript to create the dynamic content. Below is the main method for the process.</p>

{% highlight JavaScript %}
function generateRandomJokes(numberOfJokes, type) {
  var jokes = grabValidJokes(type);
  var jokesLength = jokes.length;
  var divRandomJokes = $(".joke-lockup");
  while (numberOfJokes > 0) {
    var randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * jokesLength);
    divRandomJokes.append(createJokeUnit(jokes[randomIndex].text, randomIndex));
    jokes.splice(randomIndex, 1);
    numberOfJokes--;
    jokesLength--;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The method above is a little more complicated than it needs to be, but that is because of accounting for future possible uses. While each page in their current state only features one joke, this method is capable of producing as many jokes as the call to it specifies. When a joke is selected, it will create the desired HTML divs and links, and then remove the joke from the main array. This guarantees it will not be selected again if we wanted more than one random joke.<br><br>
	
An interesting utilization of Jekyll's capabilities is also featured in the JavaScript file. Rather than creating an array containing all the jokes directly in the <i>.js</i> file, all jokes are stored and categorized in separate <i>.yml</i> files in the _data folder. This allows for an easy to read and modify format as seen below.

{% highlight yaml %}
 - {text: "Shout out to the people wondering what the opposite of in is."}
 - {text: "Whiteboards are remarkable."}
 ...
{% endhighlight %}

<p>To import the data into the <i>.js</i> file, it requires the YAML header. This is denoted by two lines of '---' at the top of the file. This signals to Jekyll to parse this file and look for any liquid tags. In this case, we use liquid to import the data from the <i>.yml</i> file. Below is the file <b>before</b> Jekyll generates the static webpage.</p>

{% highlight JavaScript %}
{% raw %}
function grabValidJokes(type) {
  var oneLiner={{ site.data.one-liner | jsonify }};
  var traditional={{ site.data.traditional | jsonify }};
  ...
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>When this file is parsed by Jekyll, it will replace these lines to look like below. I added formatting for readability.</p>

{% highlight JavaScript %}
{% raw %}
function grabValidJokes(type) {
  var oneLiner=[
  {"text":"Shout out to the people wondering what the opposite of in is."},
  {"text":"Whiteboards are remarkable."},
  ...];
  var traditional=[
  {"text":"Why is Peter Pan always flying?<br><br>He Never Lands."},
  {"text":"What do you call cheese that isn't yours?<br><br>Nacho cheese."},
  ...];
  ...
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>With the joke generator in place, the rest of the webpage was a simple process. The final result can be seen below with very little difference from the initial plan.</p>

	<div class="img-center">
		<img width="100%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/project/{{ page.projectFolder }}/completed-webpage.png" alt="Final result for A Jokeful Day">

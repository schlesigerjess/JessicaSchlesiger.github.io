abstract: "It takes both a frontend and a backend developer to create a finished product. There must be a programmer for every design, and a design for every programmer. Otherwise, an application is not capable of reaching its full potential. While I am a coder at heart, having an artistic ability to compliment the possible projects I will create is invaluable. In addition, thinking abstractly can be a challenging new state of mind. So, as a hobby I create and design various pieces of art to further develop my designing and artistic capabilities."

end-left: "Over the years, my ability to color, shade, and texture has really excelled. Works I was once proud of I now recognize all of the possible areas that could have been improved such as: anatomy, shading, and texturing. Having this ability widens my perspective and tests my ability to think abstractly, while also enabling my ability to create full frontend and backend projects without needing a secondary source."

<p>The hardest part of any art piece is finding a direction. <i>"<b>What</b> and <b>why</b> am I drawing?"</i> This process is easily the biggest timesink; however, it is inescapable for any project. Getting past this step is done by sketching out a concept, or drawing random scribbles until I find one I like. When a design is favorable, the lineart is refined in Adobe Illustrator.</p>

</div>

<p>Next is the fun phase: coloring and shading. This is where the work begins to come alive. During this phase, it is extremely important to create a color palette with colors that compliment each other. In this case, I chose a simple palette of blue and green with similar saturations.</p>

<div class="img-wrap full">

		<img width="98%" style="max-width:900px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/project/{{ page.projectFolder }}/baseColor.png" alt="Base Colors">
	</div>
</div>
	
<p>Next is to begin shading. Using the color palette, I use a soft brush on a seperate layer set to multiply. Seperate layers are used for each highlight and shading to ensure any actions can easily be undone. This allows me to experiment without fear of making an irreversible mistake. After feeling satisfied with the overall shading, the contrast must be checked. This is easily done using a black and white filter.</p>

<p>As seen above, the shading in the colored image looks acceptable but somehow plain. The reason being is explained through the grayscale image: there are only shades of gray in this image rather than spanning from black to white. The following images pushes the shadows and highlights further to achieve contrast that spans from black to white, and as expected the colored version is noticeably better.</p>

		<img width="48%" style="max-width:900px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/project/{{ page.projectFolder }}/afterContrast.png" alt="After Contrast Check (B&W)">
	</div>
</div>
		
<p>After the coloration and shading is settled, I always like to add texture to the piece. It helps add character and makes the piece more visually interesting.</p>

	</div>
</div>
<p>Lastly, a complimenting background helps to tie the piece together. Here, I prefer to incorporate the same colors and textures into the background to help tie the piece together; however, it is important to ensure the character does not blend into the background.</p>

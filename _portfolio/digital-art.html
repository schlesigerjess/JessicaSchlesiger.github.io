abstract: "It takes both a front-end and a back-end developer to create a finished product. There must be a programmer for every design, and a design for every programmer. Otherwise, an application is not capable of reaching its full potential. While I am a coder at heart, having an artistic ability to compliment the possible projects I will create is invaluable. In addition, thinking abstractly can be a challenging new state of mind. So, as a hobby I create and design various pieces of art to further develop my designing and artistic capabilities."

end-left: "Over the years, my ability to color, shade, and texture has really excelled. Works I was once proud of I now recognize all the possible fixes or where I could improve. Having this ability widens my perspective and enables my ability to create full projects without needing a secondary source."

<p>The hardest part of any art piece is finding a direction. <i>"<b>What</b> and <b>why</b> am I drawing?"</i> This process is easily the biggest timesink; however, it is inescapable for any project. Getting past this step is done by sketching out a concept, or drawing random scribbles until I find one I like.

When a design is favorable, it is then pulled into Adobe Illustrator to refine and finalize the lineart. This process takes significantly less time, and the following example only took X minutes.

Next is the fun phase: coloring and shading. This is where the work begins to come alive. During this phase, it is extremely important to view the piece in various sizes to ensure quality is maintained regardless of the viewer's screen size.

In addition, it is equally important to view the piece in a black and white view. This aides in viewing the piece's overall contrast; if there are no pure blacks or whites, then the piece can overall look very dull and it's hard to see those differences with color. </p>

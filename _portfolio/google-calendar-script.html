abstract: "During my employment at Hull Entertainment with Paint Nite and Plant Nite, I automated many tasks such as keeping the Google Calendars in sync with the Paint Nite and Plant Nite admin portal. This Google Calendar script pulls dates from a spreadsheet, that can be downloaded straight from the admin portal, and updates or creates the events on designated Google Calendars. This project required the following criteria to be met:
<ul>
<li>Parse Upcoming Events Spreadsheets
<li>Update or Create events on Google Calendar
<li>Events are on separate calendars based on their regions
</ul>
This project is modified from the customized version and anyone may use it freely. "

end-left: |
 Overall, this project was highly successful. The version for the company cut down hundreds of hours spent synchronizing events and guaranteed the data between the portal and our Google Calendar is synchronized.<br><br>
 This project introduced me to Google's API. Google's API write up is fantastic, and I highly recommend utilizing the <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spreadsheet API</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/calendar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Calendar API</a> pages as references for all the methods used. Also, applications do have some limitations on quotas such as a runtime of six minutes and frequency of queries. Due to this limitation, the script required a 4-second delay after every 5th event updated. <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/quotas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See the list of Google's Service Quotas for more details.</a>

<p>This script has two phases: parsing the spreadsheet, and creating or updating events on Google Calendar.</p>

<h2>Parsing The Spreadsheet.</h2>

<p>Before coding, I had to identify the possible data coming in and its importance when creating an event. In this case, there are two types of data: optional and critical. 

<br><br>Optional data are details that some but not all events may have. Optional data includes a description, a location, and a calendar. Should no calendar be specified, the event is created on the user’s default calendar.

<br><br>Critical data are basic details necessary to create an event on a google calendar. Critical data includes an event ID, a date, a start time, a duration or an end time, and a title. With these basic concepts in place, a spreadsheet which implements these edge cases is below.
<br><br></p>

<div class="img-wrap full">
	<div class="img-center">
		<img width="100%" style="max-width:899px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/project/{{ page.title | slugify }}/initialSpread.png" alt="Initial Spreadsheet">
	</div>
</div>

<p>Deciding how to handle errors was my next step. Should one or more events be invalid, that does not imply all events logged are invalid. Each event is independent and should be logged regardless. So, this means the script needs to mark bad entries while continuing to push events to the calendar. 
</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
function main() {
  data = getSpreadsheetData();
  findTitles();
  for (var row=1;row<lastRow;row++) {
    try {                          // Try to parse event data
      getDuration(row);
      var calendar = getCalendar(row);
      setCell(title, row, null, "#c6ffc3", ""); // successful
    } catch (errorMsg) {
      setCell(title, row, null, "#ffb7ab", "Error - "+errorMsg); // error
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Should an error arise, the script will change the cell’s background color to red, add an error message in a note, 
and then continue. Upon fixing the error and re-running the script, it will alter the background color to green and clear the note. The image below displays what the spreadsheet looks like after being run.</p>

		<img width="100%" style="max-width:899px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/project/{{ page.title | slugify }}/finalSpread.png" alt="Final Spreadsheet">

</div>

<h2>Google Calendar Event Creation.</h2>

<p>Two main concepts that must be covered: update existing or create the event, and parse the given data for the event. Checking for existing events required an event ID to be provided. The method checks for the event on a given calendar with the event ID that was generated when initially creating the event. </p>

{% highlight javascript %}
/* 
* If the event exists, update the event then return true
* If the event does not exist, return false
*/
function eventExists(row, calendar) {
  var checkExistingEvents = calendar.getEventById(data[row][eventIDCol]);
  if (checkExistingEvents != null) {
    updateEvent(row, checkExistingEvents, calendar); 
    return true;
  } else
    return false;
}
{% endhighlight %}
	
<p>Should the above method find nothing, the following method is called to create the new event.</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
/**
* Creates the event on Google Calendar
* Sets the cell to the returned event ID so it can be found later
**/
function createEvent(row, calendar) {
  var eventID = calendar.createEvent(data[row][title], startDate, endDate, 
                                     {location: data[row][address], 
                                      description: data[row][description],
                                      colorId: data[row][eventColor]});
  setCell(eventIDCol, row, eventID.getId());  
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This mainly utilized the <i>createEvent()</i> method provided in Google Calendar's API; however, the important part is the startDate and endDate variables. These variables are set using a method that creates two dates based on parsed data.</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
/**
* Gets the startDate and endDate
**/
function getDuration(row) {
  startDate = new Date(Date.parse(data[row][dateHeader]
                                  +" "+data[row][startTime]));
  checkDate(startDate, "Date and/or Start Time");
  
  if (data[row][duration].length > 0) {
    endDate = new Date(startDate);
    addHours(endDate, Number(data[row][duration]));
  } else if (data[row][endTime].length > 0) {
    endDate = new Date(data[row][dateHeader]+" "+data[row][endTime]);  
  } else
    throw ("user does not have either a duration or an endTime");
  
  checkDate(endDate, "End Time or Duration");
  if (endDate <= startDate) 
    throw ("something wrong with end time or start time.");
}

/** Checks if our created date is valid **/
function checkDate(date, string) {
  if (isNaN(date.getTime())) 
    throw ("cell not valid: "+string); 
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Surprisingly, the hardest part was parsing the date information. Since the user had the liberty of using either a duration or end time, the method needed multiple checks in place to handle the options. In addition, parsing a date from a string can be unreliable should it be formatted incorrectly or with a spelling error and thus each date required a validity check. In the end, the method does account for any user error, but admittingly is sensitive to the information given to it.</p><br><br>

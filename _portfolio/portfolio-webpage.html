description: Creation of a responsive portfolio website to provide more details than a typical resume. This project utilized new concepts such as Jekyll, SASS, and Liquid.

abstract: |
 This project created a responsive website which hosts my detailed resume and portfolio. It was important to provide both an overview look and an indepth analysis of accomplishments. So, I set the following requirements for the website: 
 <ul>
   <li>Simple, sleek design; allow content to be the main focus with little to no distractions
   <li>Index’s Content: About, Experience, Projects, Skill Sets, and Contact
   <li>Portfolio subpage with a full list of projects
   <li>Project write-up pages which detail the purpose of the project and process it took to complete it
   <li>Allow the reader to get a professional but personal feel for who I am
   <li>Improve upon the file system I used in a previous trial-run project
 </ul>
 Before beginning this project, I had no experience with Jekyll, Liquid, and SASS; however, each was heavily utilized throughout the webpage and now I feel great confidence using all three.

 I feel immensely proud of the outcome for this project. The webpage is sleek and quick while also being fully responsive. The file system which Jekyll enables was perfect for this project and will allow for easy additions and modifications in the future. Liquid and SASS were new concepts when beginning the project; however, now I feel great confidence in both languages and plan to use them in all future websites.<br><br>
 One thing I’d adjust for my next project is to use a task management system. This allows users to create a job with tasks and keep track of overall progress. While I wasn’t having problems staying on task with this project, it would have been nice to have a place which tracks all of my progress, bugs, and future goals. With a larger project, a simple to-do word document will not be sufficient.<br><br>

<p>Many of the previous hurdles from my trial-run webpage, <a href="/portfolio/what-a-kerfuffle">WhatAKerfuffle.ml</a> prepared me for the limitations of hosting this webpage for free. In the previous write-up I explain how Github Pages and Freenom.com can be used to host a webpage for free with a custom domain with the only limitations being open source and not https secured. Since this is an open project and I do not collect nor store any user information, these limitations were acceptable costs for a free webpage. <br><br>
	
In addition, I set out to improve upon the mistakes previously made. The most pressing being an organized file structure. While the trial webpage wasn’t terrible, it was a very manual system with lots of refactoring. This time, I sought out for a static webpage file management system. Luckily, I stumbled upon Github's Jekyll static webpage generator.</p><br><br>

<div class="quote">
"Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories"
</div><br>

<p>It took a couple of days of hammering through examples and trial-and-error processes, but by the end I had a comprehensive understanding of the file system, variables, imports, and site generation. This system is fantastic and enabled this webpage's file system to be less manual and better organized.</p>

<div class="img-wrap full">
	<div class="img-center">
		<h3>Trial-run Webpage vs Portfolio Webpage</h3>
		<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/project/{{ page.title | slugify }}/badFileSystem.png" alt="Trial-run webpage's bad file structure.">
		<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/project/{{ page.title | slugify }}/goodFileSystem.png" alt="Portfolio webpage's good file structure.">
	</div>
</div>
<p>As seen above, the portfolio webpage has all subpages neatly organized. What's not shown here is how Jekyll allows imports of numerous stylesheets which will be compiled into one file when building the webpage. This enables the user to be fully organized in their repository, while also being optimized for bandwidth use. With these structures in place, it was time for actual web design.<br><br>
	
Before coding anything, a well thought-out design must be in place. This reduces the time spent adjusting the code for design adjustments, while also producing properly structured source code. While the end result may diverge from the original design, the basic design and structure aids in predicting future functionality needs between pages. See the initial design below.</p>

<div class="img-wrap full">
	<div class="img-center">
		<img width="100%" style="max-width:800px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/project/{{ page.title | slugify }}/originalDesign.png" alt="First Design">
	</div>
</div>

<p>Multiple small adjustments were made to the design since starting the project such as: adding a logo, removing the personal image, swapping the order of Skill Sets and Sample Projects, etc. All of these small adjustments lead to a more visually clean and inviting experience for the user. Most of these adjustments were suggestions from one of my professors, Dr. Armstrong. Her feedback was invaluable.<p>

	<div class="img-center">
		<img width="100%" style="max-width:800px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/project/{{ page.title | slugify }}/finishedPage.png" alt="First Design">
	</div>
</div>
	
<p>There are a few big-ticket features with this webpage. First is the use of Liquid and YAML headers. These headers reduce the need for repeated code by allowing the user to declare variables accessed through Liquid tags. For example, project writeup pages, like this one, share the following YAML front matter. I have added comments for clarity.</p>
	
{% highlight c %}
---
layout: project
title: 
projectFolder: 
date:    	// optional
tags: 
description:	// project's thumbnail text
img: 		// project's thumbnail and abstract image 
abstract: 
end: 		// if there is no ending image
end-left:	// used for text if there is an ending image
end-right:	// used for img 
---
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Following this header is the page's main body content - what you're reading through right now. This allows the rest of the HTML to sit in a layout HTML file titled <i>project.html</i> which uses the Liquid variables given here to build the page. This greatly reduces the need to repeat snippets of code, such as the div declaration. One adjustment to the <i>project.html</i> will automatically be reflected on all the pages that use the layout, which allows for speedy reformatting when needed.<br><br>
	
This is not the only use of Liquid for this webpage. Liquid is also used to generate the tag system used. Should one of the tags listed at the beginning of this page be clicked, it will bring the user to a page that lists all projects that contain that tag. In addition, on the homepage under Skill Sets the "See example" text will bring the user to the tag page. Liquid is used to gather all the pages listed with the desired tag, and thus eliminates the need to manually fill and update every tag page available.</p>

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<div class="tag-page-bar">
   <div class="tag-page container">
      <h1>Projects with tag: {{ page.title }}</h1>
      {% assign projects = site.portfolio | sort: 'date' | reverse %}
      {% for project in projects %}
         {% if project.tags contains page.title %}
            {% include projectContainer.html %}
         {% endif %}
      {% endfor %}
   </div>
</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Liquid is an easy language to learn and it offers many complex behaviors that reduce a creator's manual work. In a similar vein, SASS also enhanced my ability to stay organized and reduce repeated code. SASS is a CSS extension that allows the use of variables, nested rules, imports, and much more. SASS is not only easier to read, but it also enables variables which reduce the need to scatter common values throughout the code. For example, a typical webpage's text color, main accent color, and link color will always be the same throughout all pages, so a variable can be assigned to each hex color. Then, this variable can be used in place of the hex color. This enables the user to only make one change to the variable if he or she ever wants to change the color, rather than having to dig through their code and find all instances.</p>

{% highlight sass %}
$textColor: {{ site.data.layout.textColor }}

$mainAccent: {{ site.data.layout.mainAccent }}
$mainAccent-light: lighten($mainAccent, 25%)
$mainAccent-dark: saturate(darken($mainAccent, 10%), 20%)

$grayAccent: {{ site.data.layout.grayAccent }}
$grayAccent-light: lighten($grayAccent, 25%)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>As seen above, I declare six different colors that are used throughout the webpage. Say I want to change the main accent color from blue to green, it will only take the adjustment of <i>$mainAccent</i> for the whole webpage to follow suit. This kind of capability is not available in CSS, yet SASS is close enough to the language it is easy to pick up and learn.<br><br>
	
Last but not least, jQuery was used to create some small animations along the site. One example is the sliding <i>Skill Sets</i> bars on the homepage. These bars fill up once scrolled into view. To create this functionality, a mix of Liquid and jQuery was used. </p>

{% highlight javascript %}
{% raw %}
{% for skills in site.data.settings.skills %}
   var skillsBar{{ skills.title | slugify }} = $('.skill-icons-{{ skills.title | slugify }}').offset().top;
   console.log((skillsBar{{ skills.title | slugify }}-windowHeight), windowScroll);
      if (windowScroll > (skillsBar{{ skills.title | slugify }}-windowHeight)){
         moveSkillBar('.skill-icons-{{ skills.title | slugify }}');
      }
{% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The code snippet above uses Liquid to pull all the skill set section's options and create their corresponding variables. Upon site generation, the above snippet converts to the following: </p>

{% highlight javascript %}
{% raw %}
var skillsBarprogramming = $('.skill-icons-programming').offset().top;
console.log((skillsBarprogramming-windowHeight), windowScroll);
if (windowScroll > (skillsBarprogramming-windowHeight)){
   moveSkillBar('.skill-icons-programming');
}
	
var skillsBardesign = $('.skill-icons-design').offset().top;
console.log((skillsBardesign-windowHeight), windowScroll);
if (windowScroll > (skillsBardesign-windowHeight)){
   moveSkillBar('.skill-icons-design');
}
	
var skillsBarutilities = $('.skill-icons-utilities').offset().top;
console.log((skillsBarutilities-windowHeight), windowScroll);
if (windowScroll > (skillsBarutilities-windowHeight)){
   moveSkillBar('.skill-icons-utilities');
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This is the magic of using Liquid and Jekyll for the site generation; while the first snippet may be hard to read initially, this code avoids hard coding any class names. This means if a new category is added or an existing category is altered this functionality will not break.</p><br><br>

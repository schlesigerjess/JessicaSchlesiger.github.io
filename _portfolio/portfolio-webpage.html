abstract: "This projected aimed at creating a responsive webpage which hosts information about myself and the projects I have done. The following are the requirements I set for myself: 
<ul>
	<li>Simple, sleek design; allow content to be the main focus with little to no distractions
	<li>Index’s Content: About, Experience, Projects, Skill Sets, and Contact
	<li>Portfolio subpage with full list of projects
	<li>Project write-up pages which detail the purpose and process
	<li>Allow reader to get a professional but personal feel for who I am
	<li>Improve upon the file system I used in a previous trial-run project
</ul>"

end: | 
 I feel immensily proud of the outcome for this project. The webpage is sleek and quick, while being fully responsive. The file system which Jekyll enables was perfect for this project and will allow for easy additions and modifications in the future. <br><br>
 One thing I’d do for my next project is use something like SAMPLE - where you can create a job and tasks and overall keep track of progress. While I wasn’t having problems implementing every design aspect, it would have been nice to have a place which tracks all of my progress, bugs, and list what I am to do next. With a larger project, a simple "to do" word document will not be enough.<br><br>

<p>Before coding anything, a well thoughtout design must be in place. This reduces the time spent adjusting code and leads to overall better formatting. While the end result may diverge from the original design, the basic design and structure is the stepping stone needed before beginning to code. See the intial design below.

With the design in place, next was deciding how I wanted to maintain the file system. Since this is a follow up project of my <a href="#">trial-run	webpage: WhatAKerfuffle.ml</a>, I set out to improve upon the mistakes previously made. The most pressing being an organized file structure. While the original webpage wasn’t terrible, it was a very manual system with lots of refactoring. This time, I sought out for a static webpage file management system. Luckily, I stumbled upon a fantastic YouTube Channel called Codecourse. He introduced me to Jekyll.</p><br><br>

<div class="quote">
"Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories"
</div><br><br>
	
<p>It took a couple of days of hammering through examples and trial-and-error processes, but by the end I had a comprehensive understanding of the file system, variables, imports, and site generation.<br><br>

After tackling this system, it was a matter of programming the back-end and ensuring the layout was adaptive and all-browsers compatable.<br><br>

Mulitple small adjustments were made to the design since starting the project. Most of these adjustments were suggestions from one of my professors, Dr. Armstrong. Her feedback was invaluable and resulted in multiple small adjustments of the overall project.</p>

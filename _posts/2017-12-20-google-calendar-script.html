abstract: "During my employment at Hull Entertainment with Paint Nite and Plant Nite, I automated many tasks such as keeping the Google Calendars in sync with the Paint Nite and Plant Nite admin portal. This Google Calendar script pulls dates from a spreadsheet, that can be downloaded straight from the admin portal, and updates or creates the events on designated Google Calendars. This project required the following criteria to be met:
<ul>
<li>Parse Upcoming Events Spreadsheets
<li>Update or Create events on Google Calendar
<li>Events are on separate calendars based on their regions
</ul>
The project was modified from the customized version to act as Google Add-on for anyone to use as of October 24th, 2017."

		<h1>The Process:</h1>
		<p>
		Parsing the upcoming event spreadsheet was the first step in this project. There are two types of data in this project: critical and optional. Critical data is basic data necessary to create an event on a google calendar. Critical data included: a date, a time, a title, and an unique event ID. Should the user attempt to create an event without one of these, it will change the cellâ€™s background color to red, and then continue adding the remaining events. Optional data is data that some events may have. Optional data included: description, location, and calendar.
